The screenshot above shows the program running one server and three clients. As seen above, when the clients are ran, they
all initially connect to the server through the same port. The way I did this was to start by opening four different instances
of Windows Powershell. Afterwards, to run the server, I used the command 'cargo run --bin server' and then 'cargo run --bin client'
on the remaining three instances of powershell for the clients. After doing so, I made sure to check that all the clients
are properly connected to the server which can be seen through the message "new connection from ...". After ensuring that all
clients have connected to the server, I started typing out messages from all the clients, checking to see if the server would
receive them. Moreover, the server could also tell us which client it received a message from through the message "From client ...".
